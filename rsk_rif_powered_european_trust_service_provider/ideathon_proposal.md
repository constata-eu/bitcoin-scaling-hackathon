# RSK/RIF powered European trust service provider.

European Commision wants to enable the European Digital Identity (e-ID) for all citizens of the European Union and regulate new services regarding identification, authentication, electronic archiving services, remote signatures and the support of electronic ledgers. E-ID will be supported in a permissioned blockchain for public sector institutions, along with other attestations of attributes form governments, universities public health, etc.

Private sector solutions can leverage the e-ID to speed business onboarding and authenticated transactions, and to issue (and revoke) private verifiable credentials, and to offer new trusted decentralized services supported on blockchains.

As the sector of decentralized identity and associated services is in full swing, many global players are positioning themselves in the technologies and solutions map, but RSK is missing.

We want to promote RSK and RIF toolchains by building a trust service provider that incorporates RSK timestamping and RIF Identity its offerings, and provides enterprise end-user tools for mass generation and verification of Verifiable Credentials with private attribute attestations. We want to implement DID:RSK support on existing wallets, and a bridge between DID:RSK and the European Identity.

## Value proposition

We think a trust service provider that fully embraces a public DLT and open source can enhance trust and cybersecurity while reducing operating costs. Its solutions will have a competitive advantage for public sector contracts due to reduced vendor lock-in risks.

Many current competitors use permissioned blockchains for ensuring fixed costs and eventual malleability, at the cost of data integrity and availability risks.

RSK and RIF have the technology and track record to enter in the EU Identity and secure archiving markets with proven technology and trusted services.

## Technical description

We have built software for generating Bitcoin timestamped electronic diplomas, certificates of attendance and badges. It is open sourced at https://github.com/constata-eu/constata .

We want to modify this software to timestamp in RSK instead, issue other types of private attestations as verifiable credentials to a DID:RSK, and use RSK for credential revocation lists.

We will also add a Verifier dashboard, where a company can set up mobile "verification points" for in-person workflows, such as presenting a student card for free entry to a museum. Our verifying system will be widely compliant with any type of schema, any SSI model of credential and even any technology of issuing or user wallet.

## Market Analysis

The european ID initiative will be mandatory, recognition by private companies in strategic sectors such as Health, Banking, Insurance. The market for onboarding and attribute based access tools as the ones we’re building will be huge.

Most of the competitors in decentralized identity are not native web3 companies. They have an approach to the market still based in silo-based strategies. In contrast, we're ready to understand a global decentralized market with standards and interoperability by default, empowering the holders to become active part of the data exchange flow.

Polygon has closed agreements with Telefonica in Spain, and Polygon ID is already present in some public research projects dealing with Zero Knowledge Proof attestations, and have publicly stated their will to invest in becoming EBSI Compliant.

RSK is known by builders, but not so much by people in the sales and regulation side.

## Project plan

The plan is to incorporate and fully embrace RSK and RIF in our offerings. 

We’ll develop the needed software and make the RSK features available to all relevant customers.

We will present the verifier at the EBSI Demo day in november. We will have the opportunity to show and pitch the solution to participants of the early adopters program with participants from public sector, technology providers and consulting firms. 

## Team and resources 

We're two companies already operating as trust service providers in europe: IVIS and Constata.eu.

IVIS (https://ivis.es) is a consulting firm specialized in digital identity, digital signatures and verifiable credentials, in both technical and regulatory aspects. Its CEO - José Francisco Ruiz - is a digital identity and decentralized identity expert and Single point of contact and coordinator of the Identity Cluster on the EBSI Early Adopters Program. IVIS has deployed the first spanish verifiable credentials real world use case 2 years ago, which is still in use.

Constata.eu (https://constata.eu) is an applied blockchain tech company, registered as a trust service provider, offering mass issuance and timestamping services in the Bitcoin blockchain. Its CEO - Nubis Bruno - is an experienced software developer and Bitcoin early adopter. The company is also a PowPeg pegnatory.

It will take us from two to three months to modify the constata software to incorporate RSK timestamping, issuance of diplomas as VCs in the DID:RSK method, and incorporating it to the verifier tool.

As we're not building a wallet, we may need to add DID:RSK support to existing wallets.

We will also need some guidance regarding the current state of the art in RSK SSI, as there are many possible DID methods in RSK, and there's also RIF identity, we want to build on the SSI framework that's better aligned with your long term SSI strategy.

Part of the budget will be used for marketing investment, to position our RSK based solution,  lead generation, and presales support. The goal is to gather as many real world success stories as possible. We don’t want to do pilots, but we’re open to do incremental deployments.
